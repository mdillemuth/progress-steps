## Description

This is a simple component that dynamically displays a progress bar with various checkpoints along the way.

This is a common design pattern that can be observed on a variety of web applications. An example might be signing up for car insurance online or completing the checkout process on an e-commerce platform.

A simple way to improve your user's experience (UX) is to keep them engaged with how close they are to being finished with what they are doing. It is not uncommon for a user to abandon a shopping cart or a lengthy application when it feels like it's going to take forever.
